# FLUPPY_BIRD_MY_OLD_PROJECT
Fluppy Bird Project
Fluppy Bird is a game development project inspired by the classic "Flappy Bird" game. In this project, I recreated the mechanics of a side-scrolling arcade game where the player controls a bird navigating through obstacles. The focus of this project was to develop smooth, responsive gameplay using simple yet effective algorithms for object movement and collision detection.

Key Features:
Physics-Based Gameplay: Implements basic physics for character motion, including gravity and velocity adjustments.
Obstacle Generation: Randomly generated obstacles that increase the difficulty as the game progresses.
Score System: Tracks and displays the player's score based on successfully navigating through obstacles.
User-Friendly Controls: Simple, intuitive controls designed for a smooth user experience.
This project allowed me to explore game development techniques, improve my coding skills in areas such as physics simulation, and experiment with user interface design.
